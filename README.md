# Google_earth_engine
This repository contains my personal collection of scripts and projects developed using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The focus is on remote sensing, land use/land cover (LULC) change detection, vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, SAVI), climate data analysis, and geospatial modeling.
